# Development

Ensure you have the Avocado CLI set up and available in your path, (eg, ensure `which avocado` and `avocado --help` give expected output).

If you do not have it installed, see [Installation](installation.md).

## Running Tests

The tests will run against the `avocado` executable in your path.

```bash
cargo test
```
